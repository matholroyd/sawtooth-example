Progress report
---------------


The fucking Sawtooth Python SDK example has the Transaction Process example as an XO example, but the client example is for submitting an IntKey transaction. Hence either need to change the client or the TP so they actually respond to each other.

Did however get the the client successfully talking to the REST server, and the TP successfully registering with the validator.
